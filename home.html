      <img src="assets/images/me.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Jeffrey Eapen">

      <p>I am a full stack web developer in this ever growing field of computer science. This is a profession where I would best be able to implement my creative thinking skills and somehow bring my ideas to life. I enjoy learning new languages and frameworks as they are also necessary to stay up to date in the constantly changing tech-world. As we grow more towards a technology-filled future, there will always be a need for developer skills. I would very much like to be a part of something special in the future that can benefit others.</p>

      <!-- <p>Some of my other interests include playing basketball, watching sports, playing video games. I love being part of a team and working with others. It's great to communicate ideas with others to get the best outcome and build on each other's skills. Helping others accomplish one common goal is proven to be an amazing thing.</p> -->
